# Concurrently update or pull all repositories
 
## What
This is a modified version of the pullall script.  It will concurrently pull and update all the repositories.  
Passing the flag 'c' will also cause the script to do clean updates and clear everything.
By default, it will look through '~' and it will do 4 at a time.  You can edit DEV and PARALLELEL, respectively to change these.
